Short description

Describes how to edit commands at the PowerShell command prompt.


Long description

The PSReadLine module provides useful keyboard shortcuts to help you edit
commands at the PowerShell command prompt. The key bindings discussed in
this article are the default key bindings on Windows platforms. You can
create custom key bindings by using the Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler command.

On non-Windows platforms, PSReadLine defaults to the Emacs edit mode. You
can change the edit mode using the Set-PSReadLineOption command. PSReadLine
has three edit modes: Emacs, Vi, and Windows.

To see the current edit mode, use the Get-PSReadLineOption command. To see
a list of the current key bindings, use the Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler
command.
